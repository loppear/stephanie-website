                                              <p>I specialize in Latin American history, with research and teaching interests in reproductive rights, revolutionary movements, foodways, public health, and diplomatic relations. My dissertation examined the changing nature of state intervention in rural Mexico as community leaders and state officials established new collaborations to improve the economic and health conditions of underserved areas of the nation. I incorporated public health history and medical anthropology into a larger discussion of social and political history in mid-twentieth century Mexico, and argued that, while the health of rural communities only marginally improved in this period, the cooperation between community and national leaders greatly enhanced the quantity and quality of state-run social services in these areas.  </p>

                                              <p>My current research projects examine the role of transnational collaborations on the development of Mexico’s reproductive rights and the intervention of medical anthropologists in technical cooperative programs between the United States and Mexico. </p>

                                              <p>In addition to teaching classes on Modern Mexico, Colonial and Modern Latin America, World Civilization, and Global Studies, I serve as an active member of the Women’s and Gender Studies program, the Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino/a Studies program, the Black Studies program, the Liberal Studies program, and the Women’s Center advisory board.</p>
